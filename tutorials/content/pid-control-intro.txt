<p>Welcome to our PID control tutorial! In this tutorial, we will be covering the basics of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control and how to implement it in real-world scenarios. We will be using Python as our programming language and will be providing code examples for you to follow along. You will learn how to program a PID controller and the importance of its components, specifically the use of a feedforward component to create a PIDF controller. Additionally, we will also be discussing the importance of controller tuning and showing you how to use the lambda tuning method, which is particularly useful in slow response systems. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement and tune a PID controller in your own projects. Let's get started!</p>

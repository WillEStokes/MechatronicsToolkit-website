<p>In this section, we will use Euler's formula to determine the output voltage of an RC circuit for a given input voltage and frequency.</p>

<p>Euler's formula, normally written as \(e^{ix} = cos(x) + i sin(x)\) where \(x\) is an angle in radians and \(e^{ix}\) is a complex number represented in polar form. The equation for the output voltage of a low pass filter can be expressed as a product of the magnitude of the input voltage, \(V_m\), and a complex exponential term:</p>

<p>
$$ V_o = V_m * e^{j(\omega t - \phi)} $$
</p>

<p>Using Euler's formula, the complex exponential can be written as:</p>

<p>
$$ e^{j(\omega t - \phi)} = cos(\omega t - \phi) + j sin(\omega t - \phi) $$
</p>

<p>Therefore, the equation for the output voltage can be expressed as:</p>

<p>
$$ V_o = V_m * [cos(\omega t - \phi) + j sin(\omega t - \phi)] $$
</p>

<p>Taking the real part of this expression, the output voltage is given by:</p>

<p>
$$ V_o = V_m * cos(\omega t - \phi) $$
</p>

<p>Where \(V_o\) is the output voltage, \(V_m\) is the maximum voltage, \(ω\) is the angular frequency in radians per second, \(t\) is time in seconds, and \(ϕ\) is the phase shift in radians.</p>

<p>The expression for impedance in our circuit, which combines a resistor and a capacitor, is:</p>

<p>$$Z = R + \frac{1}{j\omega C}$$</p>

<p>Where \(j\) is the imaginary unit, \(R\) is the resistance, \(\omega\) is the angular frequency, and \(C\) is the capacitance.</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>$$\phi = \arctan(\frac{-1}{\omega RC})$$</p>

<p>The input voltage can be expressed as</p>

<p>$$V_i = V_m * \cos(\omega t)$$</p>

<p>Where \(V_m\) is the maximum amplitude of the voltage signal. The output voltage can then be determined using Ohm's law,</p>

<p>$$V_o = IZ$$</p>

<p>Where \(I\) is the current. Substituting the expressions for the impedance, input voltage, and current, we get</p>

<p>$$V_o = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{R^2 + \frac{1}{\omega^2C^2}}}\cos(\omega t - \arctan(\frac{-1}{\omega RC}))$$</p>

<p>For an RC circuit, the output voltage can be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>
$$V_o = V_m\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (\frac{f}{f_c})^2}}\cos(\omega t - \arctan(\frac{f}{f_c}))$$
</p>

<p>Where \(f\) is the frequency of the input voltage in hertz, and \(f_c\) is the cutoff frequency in hertz, which we calculated in the previous section.</p>
</p>

<p>Using this equation, we can determine the output voltage for a given input frequency and cutoff frequency. This information can be plotted on a graph to give us the frequency response of the RC circuit, which is also known as the gain plot.</p>
</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>Here is a worked example for determining the output voltage of an RC circuit for a given input frequency and cutoff frequency, let's assume the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Input voltage \(V_m\) = 10 volts</li>
    <li>Frequency \(f\) = 1000 Hz</li>
    <li>Cutoff frequency \(f_c\) = 100 Hz</li>
    <li>Time \(t\) = 0.01 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the equation for output voltage, we can calculate the value of the output voltage:
</p>

<p>
$$V_o = V_m\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (\frac{f}{f_c})^2}}\cos(\omega t - \arctan(\frac{f}{f_c}))$$

$$V_o = 10\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (\frac{1000}{100})^2}}\cos(\omega t - \arctan(\frac{1000}{100}))$$

$$V_o = -0.61$$
</p>

<p>So, the output voltage is -0.61 volts.

<p>An RLC circuit is a simple and effective way to implement a band pass filter. It consists of a resistor \(R_1\), an inductor \(L\) and a capacitor \(C\) connected in series. It is good practice to include another resistor, \(R_2\), in series with an Inductor to represent the internal resistance due to its wire, however its value is very small. The series RLC circuit is shown in the following schematic:</p>

<p><b>Resonant Frequency</b></p>

<p>The resonant frequency for an RLC circuit can be derived by finding the frequency at which the impedance of the circuit is purely resistive (i.e., where the imaginary part of the impedance is zero). This occurs when \(X_L = X_C\) and \(Z = R + j(0)\), so, the magnitude of the impedance is simply R, and the phase angle of the impedance is 0 degrees.

<p>At resonance, we can say that:</p>

<p>
  $$X_L = X_C \rightarrow 2\pi f_rL = \frac{1}{2\pi f_rC}$$
</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>
  $$f_r = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}}$$
</p>

<p>Where \(f_r\) is the resonant frequency in hertz, \(C\) is the capacitance in farads, and \(L\) is the inductance henries.</p>

<p><b>Phase Shift, Output Voltage and Gain</b></p>

<p>We demonstrated the derivation of the expression for the <a href="\tutorials\theory\impedance.html#inductor">impedance of an inductor</a> and the <a href="\tutorials\theory\impedance.html#capacitor">impedance of a capacitor</a> in our tutorial on impedance. Combined, they give an impedance of:</p>

<p>$$Z_{LC} = X_L - X_C = j\omega L - \frac{1}{j\omega C}$$</p>

<p>The total impedance in our circuit can be expressed as:</p>

<p>$$Z = \sqrt{R_T^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}$$</p>

<p>Likewise we can find the phase shift:</p>

<p>$$\phi = \arctan^{-1} \left(\frac{X_L - X_C}{R_T}\right)$$</p>

<p>In both these expressions, impedance from the resistor, \(R\), is the component of impedance in the real plane and the combined reactance of our inductor and capacitor, \(X_L - X_C\), is the impedance in the imaginary plane. Note that for an RLC circuit, phase shift is neither proportional or inversely proportional to frequency, but instead it occurs at a specific frequency band depending on the values of the inductor and capacitor.</p>

<p>Using the same approach as for our RL and RC circuit, we can express the output voltage in our RLC circuit as a relationship between the impedance of the inductor, and the total impedance of the circuit:</p>

<p>$$V_o = V_m \frac{X_L - X_C}{Z}$$</p>

<p>This equation shows that the output voltage is proportional to the input voltage, but it is reduced in magnitude by the factor \(\frac{X_L - X_C}{Z}\), which represents the ratio of the reactance to the total impedance.</p>

<p>For an RLC series circuit, gain is neither proportional or inversely proportional to frequency, but instead it occurs at a specific frequency band depending on the values of the inductor and capacitor.</p>

<p><b>Frequency-Gain Plot</b></p>

<p>In this section, we will generate a frequency-gain plot of the Band Pass Filter using the user input values for \(R\), \(L\), \(C\), and \(V\). This will give us a visual representation of the gain of the circuit as a function of frequency.</p>

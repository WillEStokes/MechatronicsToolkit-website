<p>An RC circuit is a simple type of circuit consisting of a resistor and a capacitor connected in series. The behavior of this circuit is characterized by the time constant, which is the product of the resistance and capacitance. RC circuits are commonly used in electronics for filtering, timing, and waveform generation applications.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we'll use principles of Euler's formula, which are used to derive the expressions for the impedance in inductors and capacitors. This allows us to model the impedance in our circuit as a sinusoidal wave with a real and imaginary component. By modelling impedance, we can predict the behaviour of voltage flow through our circuit.</p>

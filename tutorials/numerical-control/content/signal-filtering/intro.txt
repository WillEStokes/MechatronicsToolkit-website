<p>RC, RL and RLC circuits are simple types of AC circuits consisting of a combination of resistors, capacitors and inductors connected in series. They are commonly used in electronics for filtering, timing, and waveform generation applications.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we'll use principles of Euler's formula, which are used to derive the expressions for the impedance in inductors and capacitors. This allows us to model the impedance in our circuit as a sinusoidal wave with a real and imaginary component. By modelling impedance, we can predict the behaviour of voltage flow through our circuits.</p>

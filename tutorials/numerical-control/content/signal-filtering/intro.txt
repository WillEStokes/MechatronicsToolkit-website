<p>Euler's formula is a mathematical equation that relates complex numbers and trigonometry. It is often used in electrical engineering and physics to describe the behavior of alternating current (AC) circuits. In this tutorial, we will be using Euler's formula to design a low pass filter using an RC circuit.</p>
<p>An RC circuit is a simple type of circuit consisting of a resistor and a capacitor connected in series. The behavior of this circuit is characterized by the time constant, which is the product of the resistance and capacitance. RC circuits are commonly used in electronics for filtering, timing, and waveform generation applications.</p>

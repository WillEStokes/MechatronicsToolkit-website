<p>The cutoff frequency of an RC circuit is defined as the frequency at which the output voltage is reduced to 70.7% of its maximum value. The cutoff frequency can be calculated using the following formula:</p>

<p>
  $$f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}$$
</p>

<p>Where \(f_c\) is the cutoff frequency in hertz, \(R\) is the resistance in ohms, and \(C\) is the capacitance in farads.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the cutoff frequency is a critical design parameter in low pass filters, as it determines the frequency at which the output voltage starts to roll off. In other words, it determines the transition between the passband and the stopband of the filter.</p>

<p>In a practical implementation, the cutoff frequency is often adjusted by adjusting the resistance and capacitance values, as well as other circuit elements. By carefully choosing the values of these components, we can design low pass filters that meet our specific requirements for filtering and signal processing.</p>

In this tutorial, we have seen the following characteristics in AC filters:
    <ul>
        <li>In RC filters, the reactance of a capacitor dominates at high frequencies, while the reactance of a resistor dominates at low frequencies</li>

        <li>In RL filters, the reactance of an inductor dominates at low frequencies, while the reactance of a resistor dominates at high frequencies</li>

        <li>In RLC filters, the impedance of the circuit is a combination of both inductance and capacitance, allowing for the design of band-pass and band-stop filters, which selectively allow a specific range of frequencies to pass through the circuit while attenuating all other frequencies</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
The design of these filters involves calculating the impedance of the circuit at different frequencies, as impedance is the combination of resistance and reactance, where reactance depends on the frequency of the AC signal. The impedance of a circuit can be represented as a sinusoidal wave with a real and an imaginary component, with the real component representing resistance, and the imaginary component representing reactance.

The use of Euler's formula, is important in the design of AC filters as it provides a way to represent the impedance of a circuit in a complex plane, where the magnitude and angle of the complex impedance represent the magnitude and phase angle of the AC signal.

In this tutorial we have seen that impedance can be represented as a sinusoidal wave with a real and imaginary component. The magnitude of impedance represents the amount of opposition to the flow of current in the circuit, and its phase shift represents the relative timing of the current and voltage waveforms. These properties are similar to the magnitude and phase of the voltage waveform, so impedance can be treated similarly in circuit analysis.

We have seen that, for an RC circuit:
    <ul>
        <li>As the frequency of the signal increases, the phase shift decreases</li>
        <li>As the frequency of the signal increases, the gain decreases</li>
    </ul>

The importance of understanding the influence of resistors and capacitors, using principles from Euler, in modelling electrical circuits lies in the fact that electrical engineers use these models to predict and control the behavior of a wide variety of systems. By understanding how resistors and capacitors interact in an electrical circuit, engineers can determine the response of the circuit to different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of electrical signals. This understanding is critical in designing and analysing electronic systems, such as filters, amplifiers, and power supplies.

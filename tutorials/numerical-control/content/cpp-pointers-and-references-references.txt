<p>How to declare references and access their values.</p>

<p><b>Declaring References</b>

<p>In C++, you can create a reference to a variable by using the & operator. A reference is an alias for a variable and cannot be reassigned to point to another variable. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code class="cpp">
int x = 5;
int &ref = x;
</code>
</pre>

<p>This creates a reference called ref that is an alias for the variable <code>x</code>. Now, you can use ref just like you would use <code>x</code>, and any changes made to ref will also be made to <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>It's important to note that a reference must be initialized when it is declared, unlike pointers which can be initialized later.</p>


<p><b>Accessing the Value of a Reference</b>

<p>You can access the value of a reference just like you would access the value of the original variable. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code class="cpp">
int x = 5;
int &ref = x;
cout << ref << endl; // Outputs 5
</code>
</pre>

<p>You can also use a reference to change the value of the original variable. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code class="cpp">
int x = 5;
int &ref = x;
ref = 10;
cout << x << endl; // Outputs 10
</code>
</pre>

<p>It's important to note that a reference cannot be <code>null</code>, unlike pointers. This means that you cannot create a reference that does not refer to a variable.</p>

<p>When using references, it's also important to remember that they are an alias for the original variable and any changes made to the reference will be reflected in the original variable and vice-versa.</p>

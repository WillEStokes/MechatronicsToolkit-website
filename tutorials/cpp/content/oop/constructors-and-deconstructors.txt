<p>Constructors and destructors are special member functions in C++ that are used to initialize and clean up objects of a class, respectively.</p>

<p>A constructor is a member function with the same name as the class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It is used to initialize the values of the data members of the object and allocate resources if necessary. If no constructor is defined in the class, the compiler generates a default constructor for you.</p>

<p>A destructor is a member function with the same name as the class preceded by a tilde ~ that is automatically called when an object of the class goes out of scope or is deleted. It is used to deallocate resources and perform other cleanup tasks.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a class with a constructor and a destructor:</p>

<p><textarea class="content-cpp">class Rectangle {
 public:
  int length;
  int width;
  Rectangle(int l, int w);
  ~Rectangle();
  int area();
};

Rectangle::Rectangle(int l, int w) {
  length = l;
  width = w;
}

Rectangle::~Rectangle() {
  cout << "Rectangle object destroyed" << endl;
}

int Rectangle::area() {
  return length * width;
}</textarea></p>

<p>In this example, the <code>Rectangle</code> class has a constructor that takes two arguments and sets the values of the length and width data members. The destructor simply outputs a message indicating that the object has been destroyed.</p>

<p>Constructors and destructors play an important role in managing the life cycle of objects in C++. By initializing objects and freeing resources when they are no longer needed, they help ensure that your program runs efficiently and effectively. In the next sections, we will explore other OOP concepts that complement and enhance the functionality of constructors and destructors.</p>

<p>Polymorphism is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP in C++, and it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class. Polymorphism enables you to write generic code that can operate on objects of different classes in a similar way.</p>

<p>There are two types of polymorphism in C++: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through function overloading, where multiple functions with the same name can be defined in a class, each with a different number or type of arguments.</p>

<p>Runtime polymorphism is achieved through virtual functions, where a member function is declared virtual in the base class, and can be overridden in the derived class to provide a different implementation. When a virtual function is called through a pointer to the base class, the correct derived class implementation is executed, based on the type of the object that the pointer is pointing to.</p>

<p>Here's an example of polymorphism in C++:</p>

<p><textarea class="content-cpp">class Shape {
 public:
  virtual int area();
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
 public:
  int length;
  int width;
  Rectangle(int l, int w);
  int area();
};

class Circle : public Shape {
 public:
  int radius;
  Circle(int r);
  int area();
};

Rectangle::Rectangle(int l, int w) {
  length = l;
  width = w;
}

Circle::Circle(int r) {
  radius = r;
}

int Shape::area() {
  return 0;
}

int Rectangle::area() {
  return length * width;
}

int Circle::area() {
  return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
}</textarea></p>

<p>In this example, the <code>Shape</code> class is the base class, and the <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code> classes are derived classes. The area member function is declared virtual in the <code>Shape</code> class, allowing it to be overridden in the derived classes to provide specific implementations for rectangles and circles. When a <code>Shape</code> pointer is used to call the area function, the correct derived class implementation is executed based on the type of the object that the pointer is pointing to.</p>

<p>Polymorphism enables you to write generic code that can operate on objects of different classes in a similar way, making it easier to create complex applications and improve code maintainability. In the next sections, we will explore other OOP concepts that complement and enhance the functionality of polymorphism in C++.</p>

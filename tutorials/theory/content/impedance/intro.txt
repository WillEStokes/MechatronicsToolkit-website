Impedance is an important concept in electrical circuits that describes the opposition of a circuit to the flow of an alternating current (AC) signal. The impedance of a circuit is a complex quantity, consisting of both resistance and reactance, and it plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of AC signals in a circuit.

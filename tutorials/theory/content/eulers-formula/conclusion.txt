The use of the imaginary unit \(i\) to represent a wave as a function of \(e\) is a powerful tool in mathematics. This representation simplifies the Taylor series expansion of the wave into a form that can be easily differentiated to obtain information about the wave. Additionally, the complex form of the wave makes it possible to calculate the phase and amplitude using trigonometry.

Euler's formula is a prime example of the elegance of mathematics, as it links exponential and trigonometric functions and provides us with a way to describe complex numbers as a magnitude and phase. Differentiation of Euler's formula allows us to easily obtain the phase and magnitude of a wave, while the polar form of complex numbers provides an alternative method to calculate these properties.

Having a true understanding of Euler's formula, and its applications, can be game-changing. Yet it is often an overlooked aspect of electrical engineering.

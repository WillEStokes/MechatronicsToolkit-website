<p>The following figure indicates the features of a sinusoidal wave, which are used to define the wave function:<p>

<div id="wave-func-plot"></div>

<p>In this figure, \(t\) is time, \(P\) is the wave period, \(\phi\) is the phase shift and \(A\) is the amplitude.</p>

<p>A cosine wave has the equation:</p>

<p>
$$V(t) = cos(2\pi * \frac{t}{P})$$
</p>

<p>We know that \(\frac{1}{P}\) is the frequency, so this expression can be re-written as:</p>

<p>
$$V(t) = cos(2\pi f * t)$$
</p>

<p>\(2\pi f\) represents the angular frequency of the wave, often denoted using the Greek term \(\omega\), that is:</p>

<p>
$$\omega = 2\pi f$$
$$\therefore V(t) = cos(\omega t)$$
</p>

<p>A phase shift is indicated by \(\phi\) and the function is multiplied by an amplitude to give us the full definition of a wave:</p>

<p>
$$V(t) = Acos(\omega t - \phi)$$

        <p>Machine learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
    
        <h2 id="supervised">Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p>In this type of machine learning, the computer is given a set of labeled data (inputs and corresponding outputs) and is trained to make predictions about new, unseen data.
            Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.
            Steps include:
            Collecting a labeled dataset
            Choosing a model
            Training the model on the dataset
            Testing the model on new data
        </p>
    
        <h2 id="unsupervised">Unsupervised Learning</h2>
        <p>In this type of machine learning, the computer is given a set of unlabeled data and is trained to find patterns or relationships within the data.
            Examples include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
            Steps include:
            Collecting an unlabelled dataset
            Choosing a model
            Training the model on the dataset
            Interpreting the results</p>
    
        <h2 id="reinforcement">Reinforcemet Learning</h2>
        <p>In this type of machine learning, the computer is given a goal and interacts with an environment to learn how to achieve the goal.
            Example include Q-Learning, SARSA, DDPG
            Steps include:
            Define the problem
            Define the agent
            Define the environment
            Define the reward function
            Train the agent on the environment</p>
